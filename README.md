<h1>To Do App</h1>
The "To Do" application has been developed in a way that enables users to add specific tasks and then change the status of these tasks to either 
"Due" or "Done". Users can also view a list of completed and incomplete tasks.

Here, you can add a task and choose to view the "Due" and "Done" tasks.

When you press on a specific task, you can change its status from "Due" to "Done" or vice versa.
